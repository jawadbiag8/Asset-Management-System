# Assets Folder

## Background Image

Please place your login background image in this folder with the filename:
- `login-background.png`

The image should be a dark teal/blue gradient background with a network pattern of interconnected dots and lines.

The login component is configured to use this image at: `/assets/login-background.png`

If the image is not available, the component will fall back to a CSS gradient background.
